/**
 * binary_tree_insert_left - a func that inserts a node as the left-child
 * @parent: is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
 * @value:  is the value to store in the new node
 *
 * Description - when a parent already has a left-child, the new node must
 *				take its place, and the old left-child must be set as
 *				the left-child of the new node.
 *
 * Return: returns a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if
 *			parent is NULL
